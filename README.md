# chat-admin
Hello, I created this admin for my own game and thought it might be useful for other people to use. It was designed with scalability and ease of use in mind, commands are invoked using the chat in the format of \[prefix]\[command] \[args] example: ;admin roblox

Hierarchy goes like

Main: Script

XSettings: ModuleScript
  
XPackageFolder: Folder
  
XXCore: ModuleScript *this is just an example of commands, you don't have to include it.*
