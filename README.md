# chat-admin
Hello, I created this admin for my own game and thought it might be useful for other people to use. It was designed with scalability and ease of use in mind, commands are invoked using the chat in the format of \[prefix]\[command] \[args] example: ;admin roblox

Hierarchy goes like

Main: Script

  Settings: ModuleScript
  
  PackageFolder: Folder
  
    Core: ModuleScript *this is just an example of commands, you don't have to include it.*
